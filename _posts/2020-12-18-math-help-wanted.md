title: Math Help Wanted
---

2020 has been a challenging year. But one of the highlights was the extraordinary global research effort that led to the first Covid vaccines. I recently had the chance to speak
to a group of researchers and graduate students in Mathematics at the University of Melbourne. One of my key messages was that Mathematicians have a lot to contribute to 
problems where they haven't trypically been as involved, for example in the Life Sciences.

This was part of a series of events called [Matrix](https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/events-01/online-seminars/), with a long list of very distinguished speakers.
